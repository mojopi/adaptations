            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The first few weeks of Semester Azul, we've been getting to know each other, establishing a routine, and are exploring our local bays and oceans.</p>
            <p>Our morning routine on many days begins with conversation and a walk. We start the day with "coffee talk," during which we catch up and chat about how we are and topics that interest us. After a short walk to the bay, we read independently for a half-an-hour.
                We then do some applied math problems that are connected to understanding the ocean in a new way (<i>e.g.</i> problems about the physics of waves, relativity, water pressure and scuba diving).</p>
            <p>In the afternoons we're often doing fieldwork or working on independent projects.</p>
            <p>Some days are focused on doing one particuar activity and developing a specific skillset (<i>e.g.</i> graphic design, photography and videography, etc.), which is connected to the greater project we're aspiring to complete by the end of the semester. Right now, we're focused on figuring out how we may be able to build some kind of small scale artificial reef that serves as both an underwater lab and a restoration project.</p>

                We started our first day diving right in, literally:). We went kayaking in Mission Bay and went tidepooling at Sunset Cliffs observing migrating whales and invertebrates in the intertidal zone—sea anemones, crabs, an abalone, and more. We observed some specimans we collected and  had a seminar around an excerpt about fishing and conservation, did math about time dilation and relativity, and also discussed how we wanted to divide our time. We learned a bit about the evolutionary relatedness of marine invertebrates and began articulating our individual interests and began brainstorming individual project ideas.

                Since most participants are from separate grade levels, an important aspect of this week was just getting to know each other. Since the first week, it's exciting to see how relationships have developed and how young people are becoming both more independent, much closer, and more reliant on each other than on the teachers.
